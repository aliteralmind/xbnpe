I have something to show you, assuming your installation is all working. But first you'll need to follow these instructions to install a minor upgrade.


Please unzip the attachment to your desktop. It contains a PhraseExpress branch:
   XBNPE- Other utilites.pxp
and its corresponding source-code folder:
   xbnpe\main\other

Open PhraseExpress, and select-and-then-delete this folder:
   XBNPE: Parent folder/XBN-PhraseExpress/XBNPE: Other utilities

Now select its parent folder:
   XBNPE: Parent folder/XBN-PhraseExpress
and click Ctrl+I. Navigate to your desktop and double click the pxp file from the attachment, then confirm yes-I-do-want-to-import (and do NOT eliminate any duplicate phrases when asked).

Close PhraseExpress.

Now, in Windows Explorer, go to your xbnpe installation (source-code) directory:

C:\programming\phrase_express\xbnpe\main

In this directory, eliminate the "other" folder, and replace it with the new one from the email attachment.

---DONE---
