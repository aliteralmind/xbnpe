ggcbinfo	{#insert zFcsTPFileNew}ggcb[q][f[ad]][[g/r/p*]][[0p*/1p/0-5,n]]{#insert zENTER2}--ggcb--{#insert zENTER}Get siGnature for the file-name in the ClipBoard.{#insert zENTER2}--[q]--{#insert zENTER}The cursor is immediately after the close-paren of a function CALL (it COULD be a signature, but what's the point?)--the function name and its parameters. For example, myFunction(-1, true). This [q] flag moves the cursor to before the parameters, and deletes the function name. The clip-board is left alone.{#insert zENTER2}--[f[ad]]--{#insert zENTER}If not provided, then only THIS java file is searched. When provided, ALL files in the default java directory (zggcbfDefaultJavaDir) are searched. if 'fad' is provided, then you will be given an opportunity to change this directory before the search begins.{#insert zENTER2}--[[g/r/p*]]--{#insert zENTER}When not provided, 'p' is used by default.{#insert zENTER}-'g'=Go to and select-copy the signature.{#insert zENTER}-'r'=Same as 'g', with the additional step of returning to the original (file-and-)cursor location.{#insert zENTER}-'p'=Same as 'r', with the additional step of pasting the signature at the original cursor location.{#insert zENTER}**NOTE: When using the 'f' flag AND EITHER the 'r' or 'p' flag, then it is assumed that there are two documents to be closed: The Search Results and the java file containing the correct signature. If you open another search-result java file (one that does NOT contain the correct signature) then close it immediately. Also note that this assumes that the Search Results window is displayed in the main-file area, NOT as a docked window/tab.{#insert zENTER2}--[[0p*/1p/0-5,n]]--{#insert zENTER}How many parameters does the function have? If nothing is provided, '0p' is used by default.{#insert zENTER}-'0p'=There are zero-or-more parameters.{#insert zENTER}-'1p'=One-or-more.{#insert zENTER}-'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', 'n'=Declare the EXACT number of parameters. The 'n' flag prompts you for an exact number (which must be 1 or greater).{#msgbox -head Proceed? -text Press OK when done.}{#insert zFileCloseDiscardChanges}	ggcbinfo
