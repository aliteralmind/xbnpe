These phrases may not be used by the TPKC-project's build processes. They are NOT bootstraps--they are only usable AFTER the TPKC-Project is fully built.

The contents of 'z_phrase_creator_ddmenus' are only for direct use (via 'xh'), and at any time (even before building TPKC). There are no phrases in this ddmenu directory that should be called by OTHER phrases.
