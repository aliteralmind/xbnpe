The counts must definitely be manually maintained.{#insert zENTER}- zzTpkcGTStpsFrmCatLstTp_* (such as zTpkcCharsGTStpsFrmCatLstTp) must be manually maintained.{#insert zENTER}{#BKSP -count 2}{#insert zENTER}--Notes for eventually automating the creating of zTpkc*AllCmdsQbl--{#ENTER -count 2}zTpkc*AllCmdsQbl must currently be manually created and maintained. Eventually, these should be created automatically.
