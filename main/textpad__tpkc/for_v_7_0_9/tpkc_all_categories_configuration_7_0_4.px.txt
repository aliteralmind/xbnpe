__README__	Reqirements for this file, and for all in category_config:{#insert zENTER}{#insert zTAB}- zTpkc*AllCmdsQbl must contain exactly zTpkc*CmdCount items (such as zTpkc*AllCmdsQbl and zTpkcCharsCmdCount). These must CURRENTLY be manually maintained, but see below for notes on automating the creation of the QBL variables. The counts must definitely be manually maintained.{#insert zENTER}- zzTpkcGTStpsFrmCatLstTp_* (such as zTpkcCharsGTStpsFrmCatLstTp) must be manually maintained.{#insert zENTER}{#BKSP -count 2}{#insert zENTER}--Notes for eventually automating the creating of zTpkc*AllCmdsQbl--{#ENTER -count 2}zTpkc*AllCmdsQbl must currently be manually created and maintained. Eventually, these should be created automatically. Some notes to help:{#ENTER -count 2}zTpkc*AllCmdsQbl are created by selecting all lines from the category's raw-global-config file, 'klw1n' on it (answer the prompt with the number of lines), and then selecting all lines and running this replacement:{#insert zENTER}{#insert zTAB}WHAT: \<([^\n\r]+)\n{#insert zENTER}WITH: [$1]{#insert zENTER}{#insert zBKSP}{#insert zENTER}Note that the final cmd's ending-newline must be selected.
