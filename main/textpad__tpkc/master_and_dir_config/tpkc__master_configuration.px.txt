__README__	zTpkcBuildModeTestOrLive and zTpkcAllCategoryAbrvLCsQbl_FORTESTMODE, once set, MUST not be changed unless and until the ENTIRE TPKC project is re-built. Changing either of these values REQUIRES that the entire TPKC project be rebuilt--all build-processes from 01 through 14. Also note that zTpkcBuildModeTestOrLive used to have the test/live values be 'on' and '' (nothing). But I changed this to 'test'/'live', in order for the phrase to ALWAYS be imported. Without a value, it is not imported.		(*Two tabs plus this comment, to force this phrase to be (a) imported, and (b) with NO autotext*)
