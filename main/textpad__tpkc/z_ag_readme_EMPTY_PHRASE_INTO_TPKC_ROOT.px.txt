__AUTO_GENERATED (AG)  **README**	(*In the videos, the auto-generated files are placed (imported) throughout the TPKC folder-heirarchy. That's not true any more. There are three specific locations to place auto-generated files  1:<<  Build process > z-Auto generated output > TPKC-build-AG: [NAME OF BUILD]  >>. Such as 'TPKC-build-AG: Test build'.  2:<<  TextPad built-in commands [DDMENU]  >>, and 3:<<  Your TPKC-user-directory  >>.  //  In each of these locations, only the active build folders must be enabled (via right-click, checking 'Enable Autotext/Hotkeys').  //  Note that the '(AG:##)' folder-name postfixes, such as  <<  Part 3of4: Generate user-cfg from tp-all-cmd list (1AG: 2) > zSUB (1AG: 2  //  2 vrsn-spcfc)  >>  still exist throughout the folder-heirarchy, but they are now only an indication to where those auto-generated files should LOGICALLY reside (and therefore which phrase-files actually-use them).*)		(*Two tabs plus this comment, to force this phrase to be (a) imported, and (b) with NO autotext*)
