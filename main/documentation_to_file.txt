When you do NOT want empty lines to be ignored in a phrase, then, yes, the {#ENTER} is required, as the entire phrase must exist on a single line when importing. I can think of two options:

-1- particularly long multi-line phrases can be put into their own text file--one phrase per file. Use actual newlines instead of {#ENTER}. Then the IMPORTED phrase would instead be

{#SETCLIPBOARD {#INSERTFILE path-to-multiline-phrase-file}}{#INSERTCLIPBOARD}

The multiline-file would not be imported.

-2- Set the paste method for the individual phrase, at the start of the import line, such as

sig1 -->{#PASTEMETHOD...}Signature line 1,{#ENTER}{#ENTER}- First Lastname{#ENTER}cell 1.212.555.5555{#ENTER}fax: 1.212.555.5555

(The PASTEMETHOD syntax is likely wrong, I don't remember it offhand.)

For simple choices, how about?

{#MSGBOX -text [OK]=Dog, [CANCEL]=Cat -ok zDogPhrase -cancel zCatPhrase}

For further choices:

zDogPhrase
{#MSGBOX -text What kind of dog? [YES]=Daschaund, [NO]=Dalmation, [CANCEL]=Bulldog -yes zDaschaundPhrase -no zDalmationPhrase -cancel zBulldogPhrase}

Note that when you simply want to return the NAME (type) of the dog, then that return-text must be in a separate phrase:

zDogPhrase
{#MSGBOX -text What kind of dog? [YES]=Daschaund, [NO]=Dalmation, [CANCEL]=Bulldog -yes zQDaschaundQ -no zQDalmationQ -cancel zQBulldogQ}
zQDaschaundQ
Daschaund
zQDalmationQ
Dalmation
zQBulldogQ
Bulldog
